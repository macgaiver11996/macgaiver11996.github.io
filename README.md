### About This Project

This project aims to educate users about the dangers of blindly copying and pasting commands from the internet. It provides a hands-on, yet completely safe, simulation of a pastejacking attack.

### âœ¨ Features

* **Interactive Simulation:** A live, "disarmed" demonstration of how pastejacking works.
* **Bilingual Support:** The entire explanation and demo are available in both **English** and **Bengali**.
* **GitHub-Themed UI:** A clean, professional design inspired by GitHub's dark mode for a better user experience.
* **Educational Focus:** The primary goal is to teach users how to identify and protect themselves from this form of deception.

### How it Works

1.  Visit the **[Live Demo](https://macgaiver11996.github.io)**.
2.  Copy the harmless-looking command from the page.
3.  Paste it into the text area to see how the clipboard content was secretly changed to a warning message.

This project uses JavaScript to intercept the copy event and replace the clipboard data, demonstrating the core mechanism of pastejacking in a safe, educational manner.
