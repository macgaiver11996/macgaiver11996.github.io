### About This Project

This project aims to educate users about the dangers of blindly copying and pasting commands from the internet. It provides a hands-on, yet completely safe, simulation of a pastejacking attack.

### ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Simulation:** A live, "disarmed" demonstration of how pastejacking works.
* **Bilingual Support:** The entire explanation and demo are available in both **English** and **Bengali**.
* **GitHub-Themed UI:** A clean, professional design inspired by GitHub's dark mode for a better user experience.
* **Educational Focus:** The primary goal is to teach users how to identify and protect themselves from this form of deception.

### How it Works

1.  **Visit the Live Demo:** Go to the [project's live site](https://macgaiver11996.github.io).
2.  **Copy the Text:** The page will show you a harmless command to copy.
3.  **Paste to Reveal:** When you paste the copied text into the provided text area, a hidden script reveals that the clipboard's content was secretly changed.

This project uses a small amount of JavaScript to intercept the copy event and replace the clipboard data with an educational warning message instead of a malicious command.
